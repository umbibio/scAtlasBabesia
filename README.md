### This page provide instructions for running statistical analysis on scRNA-Seq data of Babesia species. The analysis are as follows:

* Single-Cell RNA-seq data processing
* Pseudo-time analysis
* Fitting gene curves (smoothing splines)
* Marker analysis
* Time-course clustering

### Running the code:
To install the code please clone the library by copy pasting the following in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/umbibio/scBabesiaAtlases.git

You can download the rds folder that includes all processed data. The rds files can be used to run the analysis pipeline smoothly and generate the figures in the paper. We suggest that you save the rds folder within the same directory where the code is cloned. Alternatively, change the relative path in the code.
