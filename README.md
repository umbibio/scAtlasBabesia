### This page provide instructions for running statistical analysis on scRNA-Seq data of Babesia species. The analysis are as follows:

* Single-Cell RNA-seq data processing
* Pseudo-time analysis
* Fitting gene curves (smoothing splines)
* Marker analysis
* Time-course clustering

### Running the code:
To install the code please clone the library by copy pasting the following in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/umbibio/scBabesiaAtlases.git

The users can download the rds folder including all required files to run the analysis pipeline smoothly and generate the figures from paper. it is also suggested to creat an empty folder called <em> Input</em> to save the results to use as input of the following analysis.
